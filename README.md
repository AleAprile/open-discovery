This repository is intended to openly develop a proposal for the [Open Science Prize](https://www.openscienceprize.org/).

## Summary
Discovery is an essential task for every researcher, especially in dynamic research fields such as biomedicine. Currently, however, there are only a limited number of tools that can be used by a mainstream audience, most notably search engines. Search engines present resources in a linear, one-dimensional way, making it necessary to sift through every item in the list. Another problem is that the results of the traditional discovery process are usually closed. Therefore, the discovery process is repeated over and over again, taking away valuable time and resources from the actual research.
We propose BLAZE, the comprehensive open science discovery tool. BLAZE goes far beyond the functionality of search engines and social reading lists. It leverages the existing open science ecosystem to provide topical maps of research fields, involving not only publications, but also datasets, presentations, source code and media files. The resources are further enriched with altmetrics data and facts extracted from open content.
BLAZE will enable users to discover open science content from a single, intuitive interface. An edit mode will provided for users to make changes to the maps and to introduce new papers and topical areas. The collaboration history of a map is preserved and the maps themselves are open, so users can embed them on their own websites and export the structure into other open science tools.
Making the discovery process visible will have many advantages. Researchers are able to reuse maps, saving valuable time and effort. They can build on top of each otherâ€™s work and identify collaborators long before the research is usually communicated.
There is an existing, early-stage protoype for BLAZE. With the Open Science Prize, we want to extend this prototype to a much more comprehensive tool. 
BLAZE will show the enormous potential of open science for innovation in scholarly communication by providing a structured, multi-dimensional approach to discovery.
