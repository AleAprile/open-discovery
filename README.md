# open-discovery
This repository is intended to openly develop a proposal for the [Open Science Prize](https://www.openscienceprize.org/).

## Summary
Discovery is an essential task for every researcher, especially in dynamic research fields such as biomedicine. Currently, however, there are only a limited number of  tools that can be used by a mainstream audience.

We propose BLAZE, an open discovery tool that goes far beyond the functionality of search engines and social reading lists. The tool builds on Pubmed Central and other open content sources and will provide topical maps for a given list of papers, e.g. a search result or a journal volume. The maps are created automatically using fulltexts to calculate similarities and derive topical structures among papers. Furthermore, they will be enriched with features that are extracted from the papers (e.g. all papers with the same species are highlighted). 

BLAZE will enable users to do their discovery in a single interface. Users can interact with the maps, explore different topical areas, filter and read individual papers in the same interface. An edit mode will provided for users to make changes to the maps and to introduce new papers and topical areas. Users can openly share maps with others and export the structure in various open formats. 

BLAZE will be based on the existing open source visualization [Head Start](http://github.com/pkraker/Headstart), and make extensive use of the digital open science ecosystem, including, but not limited to, open content, content mining services, open source solutions, and open metrics data.

With this tool, we want to show the potential of open science for innovation in scholarly communication and discovery. In addition, we believe that this tool will increase the visibility of and awareness for open content and open science in general.
